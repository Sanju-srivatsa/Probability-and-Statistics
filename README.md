### **Detailed Notes on Probability and Statistics**

#### **1. Introduction to Probability**

**What is Probability?**

Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1:
- **0** indicates the event will not happen.
- **1** indicates the event will definitely happen.

**Probability Formula:**
\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\] 

**Example:** If you flip a coin, the probability of getting heads is:
\[
P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

**Sample Space (S):**
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

- S or Ω might be used to denote the sample space.

**Example:** For a die roll, the sample space is \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \).

#### **2. Types of Probability**

**1. Classical Probability:**
- Based on the assumption that all outcomes are equally likely.
- **Example:** The probability of drawing an ace from a standard deck of 52 cards is:
\[
P(\text{Ace}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}
\]

**2. Empirical Probability:**
- Based on observed data from experiments or historical records.
- **Example:** If it rains on 30 out of 100 days, the empirical probability of rain is:
\[
P(\text{Rain}) = \frac{30}{100} = 0.3
\]

**3. Subjective Probability:**
- Based on personal judgment or experience rather than data.
- **Example:** A doctor might say, "There’s a 90% chance that this treatment will work," based on their experience.

#### **3. Definitions - Sets and Elements**

A **Set** is a collection of distinct elements or members, often representing possible outcomes.

**Notation:**
- A set is denoted by a capital letter, e.g., \( A = \{a, b, c, d\} \).
- An element belonging to a set is written as \( a \in A \).

**Defining a Set:**
1. **Listing all the elements:** \( A = \{a, b, c, d\} \)
2. **Describing the properties:** e.g., "A is the set of all vowels in the English alphabet."

#### **4. Definitions - Sample Spaces and Factorial**

**Sample Space (S):**
- A set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
- **Example:** For a coin toss, \( S = \{\text{HEADS}, \text{TAILS}\} \).

**Factorial (n!):**
- The product of all positive integers up to \( n \).
- **Example:** For three colored marbles, the number of ways they can be arranged is \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \).

#### **5. Definitions - Events**

An **Event** is a subset of a sample space that includes one or more outcomes.

**Example:** 
- If you roll a die, \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \).
- An event, such as rolling an even number, is \( E = \{2, 4, 6\} \).

**Probability of an Event:**
\[
P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes in the sample space}}
\]
**Example:** The probability of rolling an even number on a die is:
\[
P(\text{Even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
